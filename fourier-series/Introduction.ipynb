    "In `âˆž-ContinuousString.ipynb`, we expressed the initial shape of a continous string at rest ($\\dot{y}(x) = 0$) as the superposition of normal modes with real amplitudes. The behavior of a  perturbed string can be complex and intimidating to analyze directly. However, we decomposed the motion into simpler compononets (normal modes). By applying Fourier's Theorem, we can mathematically express any initial shape of the string as a sum of these sine and cosine functions (the normal modes), each multiplied by specific coefficients. Fourier analysis therefore serves as a bridge between the physical behavior of a string and the mathemtical framework that describes it. Furthermore, since the string can take any shape between $x = 0$ and $x = L$, we can extent this framework to the mathemtical function $f(x)$ defined from $0$ to $L$.\n",
