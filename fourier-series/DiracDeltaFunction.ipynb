    "### Motivating Dirac delta function with Kronecker delta function\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kronecker delta function $\\delta_{ij} \\equiv  \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{for } i \\neq j \\\\ 1 & \\text{for } i = j \\end{cases}$ has a \"sifting property.\" For a function $f$ and $m \\isin \\Z$, $\\sum_{n = -\\infty}^\\infty f(n) \\delta_{mn} = f(m)$ for discrete modes, since $\\delta_{mn} = 0$ for all $n$ except $n=m$, so the only remaining term in the sum is $f(m)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dirac delta function $\\delta(x-a)$ plays a similar sifting role for continuous variables or modes. The function is given by $\\delta(x-a) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{for }x \\neq a \\\\ \"\\infty\" & \\text{for } x = a\\end{cases}$ where $\"\\infty\"$ is more rigorously defined later. Conceptually, the graph of the Dirac delta function as a function of $x$ will be 0 for all values of $x$  not equal to $a$. The function exhibits an infinitely large spike at $x=a$, idealized to have zero width. The area under this spike is equal to 1. Mathematically, this integral property is given by\n",

    "Therefore, $\\delta(x-a)$ selects the value of $f(x)$ at the point $x=a$, sifting out the values of $f(x)$ at all other points. Let $a=0$, setting the \"kick\" at $x=0$ and all other values to 0. It may be helpful to conceptualize $\\delta(x-a)$ as a distribution, not a function. "

    "The result is a constant, meaning that the frequency spectrum of the Dirac delta function centered at 0 is constant at all frequencies (or in this context, wavenumbers), and they all have equal amplitude. This aligns with our expectations for an idealized impulse. By taking the Fourier transform of a Gaussian, one can see that Fourier synthesizing a narrow Gaussian requires a very broad range of frequencies, a conclusion that can be extended to other distribtions. To synthesize a function with a minimum timescale of $\\Delta t$, one must have Fourier components covering a range of angular frequencies on the order of $\\frac{1}{\\Delta t}$. For this infinitely narrow kick, $\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0$, so $\\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\rightarrow \\infty$. Therefore, we expect every frequency to have an equal amplitude, since an infinite range of frequencies must contribute, and we qualitatively expect a constant.  "

    "The result is now a sinusoidal wave with a constant frequency and non-zero phase shift both dictated by wavenumber $k_0$. The amplitude is constant. A single frequency component in the frequency/wavenumber domain manifests itself as a pure sinusoidal wave in the time/space domains, which aligns with our expectations. By isolating a single \"input\" frequency in one space, we also isolate its oscillatory \"output\" in the other space. "
