    "### Waves on Transmission Lines\n",

    "We can apply our understanding of electromagnetic waves (`Maxwell'sEquations.ipynb`) to the transmission of information. For transmission line problems, the long wavelength limit of circuit theory approximates the exact solutions given by Maxwell's equations. In essence, all circuit problems are electromagnetism problems, and can be solved through the following relations: \n",

    "Information can be conveyed using either the time-varying voltage between two conductors  or the time-varying current flowing through them. In the latter case, the current enters the target device through one wire and exits through the other.\n",

    "**Transmission Line Model**: we think of transmission lines like pipes to guide EM waves, with capacitance and inductance distributed across its lenght. In the lumped element model (an approximation), we imagine the line as a series of very small, repeating units. Each units contains an inductor (storing magnetic energy) and a capacitor (storing electric energy). Inductors are isomorphic to beads on a string, and capacitors bridge two condcutors at each small unit. This model brekas the line into smaller segments to break down the travelling of voltage and current waves. \n",
